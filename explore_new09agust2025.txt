Visualize data scientists your history chat of gpt :=: 

Prompt: Please analyse my entire chat history and extract all major conceptual themes discussed. Categorise them into logical groups.
Then generate a fully standalone HTML file that renders an interactive 3D concept map using Three.js. Each concept should be a colour-coded node (based on its category), and conceptual relationships should be shown as lines connecting the nodes.
Requirements:
- Use three.module.js and OrbitControls.js via proper ES Module CDN imports (or give relative paths if using local files).
- The final output must work when served from a modern HTTPS server (or ideally just locally) without a build step.
- Make sure all module specifiers are either fully qualified URLs or proper ./ relative paths.
- Assume I may host the JS files locally, so also include guidance for doing so correctly if needed.
